1)
CUnit and Check differ in number of places.
Here is a list of few of them:

	1. In check there are two types of setup/teardown function namely
	   "checked" and "unchecked". Checked if executed before unit test
		 while unchecked is executed only once a test group (or super test).
		 In Cunit "unchecked" is only supported.
	2. Check can optionally fork a new process to execute a unit test but
	   in CUnit there is no fork.
	3. The functions for reporting error is different (ex. ASSERT() in Cunit, 
	   fail_unless() in Check).

Inorder to take care of the above differences in the XML file (to make it
generic) note the following suggestions for the C code generator:

	1. To add "checked" setup/teardow functionality in CUnit the C code
	   generator can add a function call to "checked" setup/teardown just
		 after the declaration ends (we know where thats gona happen).
	2. Cant do much about that.
	3. Take functions used by Check as the standard and write wrappers 
	   (function or a macro) for CUnit.

2)
At present multiple setup/teardown pair is not supported (ie. cant have
both "unchecked" and "checked" versions at the same time).
