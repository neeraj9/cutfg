Cutfg: C Unit Test Framework Generation
----------------------------------------
The purpose of the project is to generate a c unit test framework automatically from a c implementation. The project also aims at providing an XML based unit test cases building thereby providing an abstraction over a specific unit test framework (and also a documentation engine). This technique can be utilized to include languages other than C also.

Because of my busy schedule i am unable to write proper documentation. You will find detailed documentation in docs/ directory whenever i have time.
If you want to know more about this project then try executing the scripts on the sample codes provided in sample/ directory.

Example run.
---------------
./genXml sample/sample1.c
### test_sample.xml is generated.
./genCcode test_sample.xml
### test_sample.c is generated.
